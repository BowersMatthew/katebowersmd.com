                    <h2>Our Practice</h2>
                    <p className="content-text">
                        Firefly Pediatrics was designed from the ground up, with 21st-century families in mind. Our aim is to provide modern, evidence-based care for children and young adults from birth through college while facilitating easy electronic communication and reducing paper use. Our electronic medical records were designed for pediatric use and allow us to take better, more seamless care of your family.
                    </p>
                    <p className="content-text"> Everyone's time is important. Therefore, most visits at Firefly Pediatrics are run on a schedule. You may call or send us a message through the portal to schedule both sick and well visits. In order for each patient to receive the proper care, we need to know the reason for your appointment. This will allow us to schedule the appropriate amount of time for your visit. Don't worry, we will always strive to have same day sick appointments available. Spacing arrivals appropriately will allow us to reduce your exposure to sickness in the waiting room as well as limit wait times. </p>
